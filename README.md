This is the backend part of my application DreamCatcher.com (a job Portal Service). Serverside  is fully designed in java Spring-Boot which made my application development very easy as i need to focus only on my coading logics.
We used JPA/Hibernet for database handeling and used MySQL as my initial database.
we used models to map with data base, and create a databases design such that it should be normalized.
